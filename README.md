# Quantum-Computing

For all the programs except the qcH2 and qch222 and vqe code i have used the qiskit version 2.0.0 

for simulation of the hydrogen molecule i have used the version of the following packages

pip install "qiskit>=0.44,<1.0"             "qiskit-nature==0.7.2"             "qiskit-algorithms==0.3.1"             "pyscf"\
for simulation of the h2 molecule you need to create a new environment where you installed the above specified versions to get the code running
